## About The Project

IDika REST-API is a powerful and versatile project designed to provide seamless access to a wide range of anime-related information. Built upon the foundation of web scraping, the project harnesses the capabilities of scraping technologies to gather data from various anime websites that lack APIs. Additionally, it offers several other useful features, including real-time game username checks with integrated Redis support, eliminating the need for time-consuming requests.

##### Why Choose IDika REST-API:

* **No API Dependency**: Many anime-related websites lack APIs, limiting the accessibility of their data. IDika REST-API solves this challenge by leveraging web scraping techniques, ensuring that users can access information from a wide array of sources that would otherwise be unavailable through traditional API integration.
* **Faster Development**: By utilizing IDika REST-API, developers can significantly reduce the time and effort required to gather anime-related data and implement additional functionalities. The integration of Redis for game username checks further optimizes performance, ensuring quick and efficient responses. This streamlined development process empowers developers to focus on building innovative features and creating engaging experiences for their users.

In summary, IDika REST-API offers a robust solution for accessing anime-related information from websites without native APIs. With its extensive content, seamless integration capabilities, and efficient username checks, this project caters to the needs of developers, content creators, and anime enthusiasts alike, fostering a vibrant and thriving anime community.

## Built With

IDika REST-API, is crafted using a powerful stack of technologies to ensure robustness, efficiency, and seamless functionality. The following cutting-edge technologies have been employed to create this exceptional solution:

* **Typescript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enables developers to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
* **ExpressJS**: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the creation of robust APIs and web services.
* **MongoDB**: A popular NoSQL database system that provides high performance, scalability, and flexibility for storing and retrieving data.
* **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store that accelerates data access, making it perfect for caching, session storage, and real-time applications.
* **Swagger**: An open-source framework that facilitates the design, building, documentation, and testing of APIs, ensuring consistency and ease of use.
* **Cheerio**: A fast and flexible HTML parsing library that simplifies data extraction from HTML documents, making web scraping tasks efficient and convenient.
